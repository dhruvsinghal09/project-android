In this project i have created a 2D-game with Android Studio named as "I Have to Fly". 
## Project Description
1. The game starts when we click on the Play button.
2. Then on the top right corner i am storing the high score which will be updating itself if we get a score higher than the current high score.
3. On the bottom left corner there is a volume option that is we can control the game volume from there i.e we can mute or unmute our game as per our convenience.
#### Game features:
1. Once the game is started by clicking or tapping on the right side of the screen we can shoot bullets and no. of birds we kill before dying will be the score at the end of the game.
2. By tapping on the left side of the screen we can control the position of our player i.e of our pilot and if our pilot touches either side of the screen i.e uppermost or the bottom it will be the end of the game i.e our pilot dies.

3. Also if our pilot collides with the bird or any of the bird passes through our pilot it will also result in the end of the game.

4. So we have to keep shooting i.e the more we kill the birds the more is the score and more is the chance of our pilot's survival.
